"""Predicting what an action would do, without doing it.

An engine that can only act cannot reason about acting: a goal that needs a file written, a command run or
a message sent would leave the search blind at exactly the point where the plan gets interesting. A
Simulator closes that gap — it answers "if this were performed, what would it produce?" so the outcome can
be scored and chosen between, while the action itself is never performed.

What a prediction is NOT, and the engine enforces all three: a prediction is labelled ``predicted`` (a UI
can show it as such), it is never learned as a fact (``AgentState.learn/apply`` ignore it), and it can
never settle a goal (``LLMEvaluator`` refuses a ``done`` built on a predicted outcome). A prediction is a
hypothesis the search may use; only a real probe becomes knowledge.
