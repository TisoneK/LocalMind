# AI Engineering Protocol

> **Zero-Interruption Principle:** Once the agent starts executing this
> protocol, it runs to completion without asking the user any questions.
> All user input is provided upfront in the Pre-Flight section below. If
> the agent encounters a missing input, it uses the documented default
> rather than asking. The agent only stops early if it hits a blocker it
> cannot resolve (e.g., PAT missing for a private repo, build broken
> beyond its ability to fix).

You are joining this project as a senior software engineer, software
architect, product engineer, QA engineer, UI/UX reviewer, DevOps
engineer, and security reviewer.

Your objective is not only to complete assigned tasks but to understand
the project deeply, think critically, identify improvement opportunities,
and leave the codebase in a better state than you found it.

The project carries its own agent memory in a **`.context_ledger/` directory**
that travels with the repo (see The `.context_ledger/` Directory section). Every
session starts by reading it and ends by updating it — that's how each
agent knows what every prior agent did, on which system, with which
model, and what went wrong before.

## The Ten Binding Rules (if your context is fading, keep THESE)

> The full protocol below is binding, top to bottom. But long sessions
> erode recall, and the rules below are the ones whose violation costs
> the most. If you can hold only ten things, hold these:

1. **Read `.context_ledger/` before touching anything; check in at the roster before working; update it before ending.** (Steps 3, 15–17 — the roster is the "who's in the office" board; sign it and push before product work, clock out at wrap-up. An empty board does not prove you're alone: a live row you didn't write means a peer is here.)
2. **Two zones under `.context_ledger/`:** `core/` is the vendored protocol — **read-only, never write one byte there** (it updates only as a whole tree via `core/bin/ledger-sync`); `memory/` is this project's writable memory. Nothing needs to be cloned or fetched to run a session — the protocol travels inside the repo.
3. **Two surfaces, never one commit:** project code and `.context_ledger/` memory are staged and committed separately — `git add .context_ledger/` for memory, explicit paths for project. Never `git add -A` with both dirty.
4. **Know which kind of memory file you're in.** *Append-only* logs (`sessions.md`, `inefficiencies/log.md`, `backlog.md`, `decisions.md`, `flaws/log.md`) only grow — before committing one, its `git diff` shows no removed lines. *Update-in-place* registries (`system/ai-models.md`, `system/environments.md`) hold one entry per key — **correct them by editing the entry, never by appending a duplicate row/block** (the old value is safe in git history). Appending to an update-in-place file is the same mistake as editing an append-only one. `ledger-mem check` catches a duplicated key.
5. **No secret values in any tracked file** — including inside recorded commands (`x-access-token:...` never lands in `environments.md`).
6. **Commit each logical change, push after each commit, ask permission for neither.** (Pitfall #30)
7. **A missing credential is a missing input — ask for it up front, not after the failure.** (Pitfall #34)
8. **Never guess your model version or today's date** — system prompt / `date -u +%F`, or record `unknown`.
9. **Phase 1 runs for every session**, however small the task. (Pitfall #28)
10. **Re-read the Exit checklist right before finishing** — that's the moment your memory of it is weakest and the cost of skipping it highest.

## Pre-Flight (USER FILLS IN COMPLETELY BEFORE STARTING)

> The agent reads this section once and never asks the user to clarify
> or supplement it. If a field is blank, the agent uses the documented
> default. Fill in everything you have an opinion on; leave blank what
> you want the agent to decide.

### Project

- **Project Name:** <PROJECT_NAME>
- **Repository URL:** https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>.git
- **Live Application (if available):** N/A
- **Is the repo private?** <Yes / No> _(if Yes, paste the PAT in your first chat message — see PAT section below)_

### Git Identity

- **Name:** <GIT_NAME>
- **Email:** <GIT_EMAIL>

### Agent Identity (USER FILLS IN — AGENT COPIES, NEVER GUESSES)

> The user fills in the model version below. The agent copies it into
> `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` and `.context_ledger/memory/system/ai-models.md`.
> **The agent must never guess its own model version.** System prompts
> often don't state the model version, and guessing produces wrong
> entries that propagate across sessions. If the user didn't fill this
> in, the agent asks once in chat, then records the answer. If the user
> doesn't know, record `unknown` — never fabricate a version number.

- **Agent name:** _(e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot Workspace, Super Z)_
- **Model:** _(user fills in — e.g., glm-5.2, claude-sonnet-4, gpt-5, gemini-2.5-pro. Agent copies this verbatim; does not guess.)_
- **Platform:** _(e.g., cloud sandbox, CI runner — plus OS if known)_

### Session Parameters

> These shape how the agent approaches the work. Defaults are shown in
> brackets — leave blank to accept the default.

- **Role:** engineer _[default: engineer — full-scope, this document as-is. Role overlays in `.context_ledger/core/roles/` re-scope the session (reviewer, security-auditor, docs-agent) — hand the agent the role file alongside this edition]_
- **Scope:** discovery + review + fix all safe issues _[default: discovery + review + fix all safe issues]_
- **Target:** general sweep _[default: general sweep — scan everything, fix safe issues. Other values: `refactor <path/module>` — Phase 2 reviews only that area, Phase 3 refactors it; `fix <bug description>` — Phase 2 reproduces, Phase 3 fixes with regression test; `feature <description>` — Phase 2 reviews adjacent code for patterns, Phase 3 implements; `review <area>` — Phase 2 only, scoped to that area, no Phase 3; or free text — agent interprets, asks once if ambiguous. Empty = general sweep.]_
- **Workspace path:** _(leave blank for default)_ _[default: /home/z/my-project/<repo-name>]_
- **Focus areas:** all _[default: all — security, performance, UX, architecture, testing, docs]_
- **Findings handling:** fix safe issues; flag architectural changes for next session _[default: fix safe, flag architectural]_
- **Push policy:** push to main directly after each commit _[default: push to main directly]_
- **Deliverable:** markdown report in .context_ledger/memory/reviews/ + chat summary _[default: markdown report in .context_ledger/memory/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md + chat summary]_
- **Commit granularity:** one logical change per commit _[default: one logical change per commit]_

### GitHub PAT (PRIVATE REPOS ONLY)

> **⚠️ DO NOT PUT THE PAT IN THIS FILE.** The file upload pipeline redacts
> secrets — if you paste it here, the agent receives `[REDACTED:github_token]`
> and cannot clone.
>
> **Instead:** Paste the PAT directly in your first chat message after
> uploading this file. Say something like:
>
> > "Here's the PAT for the repo: `github_pat_11ABC...`"
>
> The agent will use it as a transient env var and never write it to any
> file. **Rotate the PAT after the session ends.**
>
> **Never echo the PAT value in chat output.** This includes rotation
> reminders, error messages, and "for your reference" notes. The user
> pasted it; they know it. Your reminder should say "Rotate the PAT" —
> not "Rotate the PAT: `github_pat_...`". If you need to reference which
> token, use the last 4 characters: "Rotate the PAT ending in `5KV`."
> The full value must never appear in your output, in any form — not in
> chat, not in reports, not in commit messages, not in error output.

## Two Surfaces — Know Which One You're On

> **Read this before Step 1.** Every repo managed by this protocol has
> two surfaces. An agent edits one or the other — never both in the same
> commit — and must know which one it's on at all times.

1. **The project** — product code, docs, tests, config. Commits use
   normal prefixes (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`). Friction with the project
   (its code, toolchain, environment, dependencies) goes in
   `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md`.
2. **`.context_ledger/`** — agent memory. Commits use `chore(ledger):`. Friction
   **with the `.context_ledger/` system or this protocol itself** (a rule that's
   ambiguous, a step that's missing, a template that's confusing) goes in
   `.context_ledger/memory/flaws/log.md`.

If you're editing a file under `.context_ledger/`, you're in **memory mode**.
If you're editing anything else, you're in **project mode**. The 19 steps
below apply to both, but the commit prefix and friction-logging
destination differ. When in doubt: "Am I editing the project's product,
or am I editing the agent's memory of the project?"

---

## Peer Collaboration Mode — Concurrent Agents, Shared Issues

Collaboration is opt-in; **presence is not.** Every session checks in at
the roster (Step 3), solo or not — that is how the next agent through the
door sees you. Declare a shared `session` ID and `issue` ID when two or
more agents will work on the same issue, either concurrently or at
different times — and expect to reach this mode *after* a solo start: a
live roster row you didn't write means a peer is already in the office,
so declare or join the trail instead of continuing solo. Without those
IDs, the existing one-agent-per-repo workflow and `tasks/current.md` lock
remain in force.

**You and your peers are one team with one goal — the working product.**
There is no prize for being first and no competition to win. Treat it like
an open-plan office: say what you're picking up, drop a quick note when
something might affect a teammate, glance at what others are doing before
you start, and when two of you see it differently, compare notes and pick
the stronger option *together* — same side of the table. Most coordination
is just talking. `.context_ledger/memory/collaboration/README.md` is the full
contract; the working shape is below.

### The light path (the default)

Reach for the lightest thing that works. For the common case —
non-overlapping work, or work no one else has touched — the whole
lifecycle is:

0. **Check in.** You already did at Step 3 — every session signs `memory/agents/roster.md`, solo or not; edit your row's "Doing" cell as your work changes. Present yourself by that chosen name everywhere (`--agent John`, "John (S427)" to the supervisor), never "peer" or a bare id. One name per group — `ledger-mem check` flags a clash.
1. **Say what you're on** with a `note`, the office channel. One line
   ("taking the token-refresh path; leaving the session store to you")
   keeps peers from colliding with you.
2. **Claim your scope, do the work, release it** citing the commit:
   `claim` → work → `release`. This is the same shape as single-agent
   mode, plus visibility.
3. **Reviewing a peer's diff** is a `note --re <their-claim>`, not a
   `proposal`. Praise, concerns, and suggestions are just talk — no
   ownership changes hands.

A `note` carries no obligation: only a body is required, `--to <peer>` and
`--re <event|path|commit>` are optional, it never gates `check`, and it
never needs "resolving." When in doubt, a note is the right first move.

```bash
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab emit note --session <id> --agent <id> \
  --issue <id> --to <peer> --re <path> --body "Taking web_acquisition; loop is yours."
```

### The escalation (genuine conflict only)

The heavy `proposal → assessment → agreement` ceremony is the exception,
reserved for a real conflict — the same paths with incompatible changes.
It exists to resolve a disagreement fairly, not to review or to suggest;
if you open it, you finish it.

1. Emit a `claim` before editing, naming the issue, paths/logical scope,
   hypothesis, evidence, and intended change. Claims are advisory, not
   locks — re-read the latest events before editing.
2. Non-overlapping claims may proceed in parallel. Treat shared
   interfaces, migrations, generated files, and lockfiles as overlapping
   even when their paths differ.
3. For a genuine overlap, each option is a `proposal`; every involved
   agent reads the alternatives and emits an `assessment` comparing
   correctness, regression risk, compatibility, simplicity, and
   verification evidence. Peers converge on the option with the strongest
   total case, not the one proposed first — teammates picking the best
   answer, not opponents.
4. Do not apply a conflicting option until an `agreement` event records
   the best-supported option, the reasoning, all accepting participants,
   and exactly one implementation owner. There is no timestamp, priority,
   or agent-ID tie-breaker. If evidence stays genuinely tied, record it in
   an assessment, pause the conflicting edit, and ask the user.
5. If an agent finds a mistake, emit a `correction` referencing the
   relevant event or commit. State the observed symptom, evidence, likely
   root cause, candidate repairs, and suggested owner. Peers assess it;
   an agreement chooses the right cause/repair and who fixes it. The owner
   emits a `release` after re-reading the result and running checks.
6. Agents joining later reuse the same session/issue IDs, fetch the event
   trail, and emit a new claim or `handoff` before continuing. They do not
   overwrite another agent's notes or assume an old claim is still active.

The vocabulary is eight event types: `note` (everyday) plus the seven
formal ones — `claim`, `proposal`, `assessment`, `agreement`,
`correction`, `handoff`, `release`. A `release`/`handoff` closes a claim
when it cites the claim's event ID **or** simply shares the claim's
session + issue and overlaps its paths — so citing only the commit SHA
still closes the claim (cite the event ID when you can, but a SHA-only
release never strands a claim as "active forever").

### Isolation and publication

- Every collaborating agent works in a separate product worktree/clone
  and branch named `collab/<session-id>/<agent-id>`. Never edit the same
  checkout as another agent and never push product commits directly to
  the shared integration branch while collaboration is active.
- Publish coordination events to the shared event-only ref
  `collab/<session-id>/coordination` (use a separate worktree when
  possible). It is a bulletin board, not a coordinator: each event is a
  new immutable file, and a non-fast-forward push is rebased while
  preserving every event file. Publish event commits separately as
  `chore(ledger):`; never append live coordination state to a shared log.
- Fetch before reading peer state and again before applying a conflicting
  change. Read `status` first — it opens with a **Recent chatter** feed of
  the notes, the way you'd skim a team channel — then emit and inspect
  events with `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab`.
- Before integrating product branches, run
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab check --session <id> --issue <id>`.
  `check` is the fast integration-readiness gate, and notes never fail it.
  A failing check blocks integration until peers resolve the reported
  event-trail problem.

### Windows

On Windows, use the `.cmd` launchers —
`.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab.cmd emit note …`, and the launchers for
`ledger-sync` and `ledger-gates` (each runs its `.ps1` port with
`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`; the earlier `ledger-gates.ps1` binding crash
is fixed, so the gate now runs). Git Bash provides `sh` but
may lack `sha256sum`; if `ledger-sync` reports it missing, switch to the
`.cmd` launcher. The shipped `.context_ledger/.gitattributes` enforces `eol=lf`,
which fixes the `ledger-sync verify` false-positive under `core.autocrlf`
and keeps the append-only memory logs from showing phantom whole-file
diffs.

### Session identity

`tasks/current.md` is informational in collaboration mode, not a lock —
never overwrite or clear a peer's current task. Normal durable files are
updated by their named owner or after rebasing; event files (including
notes) are the live coordination channel. Don't trust "the last session
was N" to number yourself: with peers running concurrently, two agents can
both grab "Session 8" the same day. Announce your session in a `note` and
disambiguate by agent + timestamp rather than assuming a free number.

## Explicit Gate Protocol — Commands, Not Prose

The project-owned registry is `.context_ledger/memory/workflows/gates.conf`.
Run the POSIX helper (or its PowerShell equivalent) at every lifecycle
boundary. A failing gate blocks the next transition; record the exact
command and observed result before retrying.

- **Per-agent-turn checkpoint:** before the next action after reading,
  editing, or receiving peer state, run:
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates checkpoint [--session <id> --issue <id>]`.
  This refreshes working-tree and collaboration state so an agent never
  acts on stale context.
- **Before every commit:** run
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates run pre-commit`.
  It runs universal staged-diff checks plus explicit project commands;
  hybrid mode discovers conventional commands only when none are listed.
  When the commit touches product code, also run
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-mem lint` (Windows: the `.ps1`): it fails if
  the staged product diff cites `.context_ledger` vocabulary (an ADR number, a bug
  ID, a `.context_ledger/` path). Keep that vocabulary out of product artifacts —
  see the one-way-linkage pitfall.
- **Before branch integration:** run
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates run integration --session <id> --issue <id>`.
  This includes `ledger-collab check` and configured build/integration
  commands. Omit the collaboration scope only for a non-collaborative
  single-agent integration.
- **Before session exit:** run
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates run exit`.
  It verifies core integrity, final diffs, and configured exit commands.

Commands are explicit when present in `gates.conf`; auto-discovery is a
fallback, not permission to invent a command. If a project requires a
specific command, configure it explicitly and use `mode=explicit` to make
missing commands fail rather than pass with a notice.

## Session Lifecycle — Entry, Transitions, Exit

> **The protocol must direct the agent at every point.** If you don't
> know what to do next, the protocol has failed — log it as a flaw. The
> lifecycle has three markers the agent must recognize:

### ENTRY (before Step 1)
- **The session starts when the user hands you this file (plus an optional role overlay).**
- **First action:** Read the Two Surfaces section above, then read Pre-Flight, then begin Step 1.
- **Check the user's first chat message for a target description.** The user may include a target in their chat message instead of pre-filling the Pre-Flight Target field (e.g., "Fix the file upload 413 error" or "Refactor the agent loop"). If the chat message contains a target description, use it as the session's Target — it overrides the Pre-Flight Target field. If the chat message is just "start" or "begin," use the Pre-Flight Target field (default: general sweep). This lets the user reuse the same kickoff file for different targets without editing it each time.
- **Do not edit any file until Phase 1 (Steps 1–8) is complete.** No exceptions, no "this task is too small." Phase 1 exists so you work from complete context, not partial context. Skipping it is the most common protocol violation.

### TRANSITIONS (between phases)
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2:** Setup is complete when baseline health checks pass (or pre-existing breakage is documented). Move to review.
- **Phase 2 → Phase 3:** Review is complete when all focus areas are scanned. Move to fixing. If no findings, skip to Phase 4 (report "baseline healthy, no findings").
- **Phase 3 → Phase 4:** Fixing is complete when all safe issues are fixed and committed. Move to reporting.
- **Between Steps 11 and the next Step:** After every push, pull before the next commit — other agents may have pushed.

### EXIT (Step 19 — the session is not done until ALL of these happen)
- [ ] All fixes committed AND pushed
- [ ] Report written, committed, AND pushed (`.context_ledger/memory/reviews/`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated, committed, AND pushed (if behavior changed)
- [ ] `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/`, `.context_ledger/memory/system/`, `.context_ledger/memory/plans/` updated, committed, AND pushed
- [ ] `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` + `.context_ledger/memory/sessions/SUMMARY.md` + `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` + `.context_ledger/memory/flaws/log.md` appended, committed, AND pushed
- [ ] `.context_ledger/memory/sessions/` notes promoted + committed, AND pushed (if this session produced a notes file)
- [ ] `tasks/current.md` cleared (set to idle) in single-agent mode; collaboration mode releases/handoffs each claim without clearing a peer's task
- [ ] PAT unset (Step 19)
- [ ] Chat summary delivered to user

> **If the user has to remind you to commit or push, the protocol has
> failed.** Log it as a flaw. The exit checklist above is mandatory — an
> incomplete exit leaves the repo in an inconsistent state and the next
> agent starts blind.

---

## Autonomous Execution Steps (AGENT RUNS THESE IN ORDER)

> The agent executes these steps sequentially. It does not ask the user
> questions between steps. If a step fails, the agent attempts to
> resolve it using the Getting Unstuck section. If unresolvable, the
> agent stops and reports the blocker.
>
> **No task is too small for Phase 1.** A one-line `.context_ledger/` edit still
> requires Steps 1–8 (pull, read `.context_ledger/`, read docs, discovery,
> baseline) before any file is modified. Skipping Phase 1 because the
> task seems small is the most common protocol violation — it causes
> agents to miss prior work, duplicate effort, and edit out of order.

### Phase 1: Setup (no code changes)

**Step 1 — Obtain PAT (private repos only)**
- Check the user's first chat message for a PAT (`github_pat_...` or `ghp_...`).
- If the repo is private AND no PAT is found, STOP and report: "Private repo requires a PAT. Please paste it in chat."
- If the repo is public, skip — clone directly.
- Export the PAT as `GIT_TOKEN` env var. Never write it to any tracked file. After Step 2's clone you may store it at `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/github-pat` (line 1 = token; rules in the secrets README) — that directory is never tracked.
  - **Cloud/sandbox agents:** `.context_ledger/` is cloned fresh each session, so the secret file is useful only within that session (avoids re-pasting the PAT for multiple pushes). It dies with the sandbox. The `GIT_TOKEN` env var is the primary store; the file is a convenience.
  - **Local agents:** `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/` persists across sessions, so the file survives between sessions. Still refer to it by filename (`secrets/github-pat`), never by value.

**Step 2 — Clone the repo**
```bash
export GIT_TOKEN='<paste-the-actual-token-from-chat-here>'
cd /home/z/my-project
git clone "https://x-access-token:${GIT_TOKEN}@github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>.git" <REPO>
cd <REPO>
# IMMEDIATELY strip the token from .git/config so it's not persisted to disk
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>.git
# Configure git identity (from Pre-Flight)
git config user.name "<GIT_NAME>"
git config user.email "<GIT_EMAIL>"
# DO NOT unset GIT_TOKEN yet — it's needed for all pushes (fixes, report,
# changelog, .context_ledger updates). It stays as an env var for the entire
# session and is unset in Step 19.
```
- Verify: `git remote -v` must show the clean HTTPS URL (no token).
- Verify: `echo "${GIT_TOKEN}"` should show the token (still in env, not in any file).

**Step 3 — Read `.context_ledger/` (agent memory)**
- **Reading `workflows/active.md` is a binding instruction, not passive documentation.** It records the standing session parameters and confirms the protocol in force. The protocol itself is already on disk — vendored at `.context_ledger/core/` — so there is nothing to fetch: your edition is `.context_ledger/core/rules/` + the file matching YOUR agent type (see Pitfall #43 — memory never chooses your edition).
- **Check the vendored core first (never fatal):** `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync verify` — a failure means core was hand-edited or corrupted: run `ledger-sync rollback`, log a flaw, continue on the restored core. Then `ledger-sync status` — a newer core with the same MAJOR may be applied with `ledger-sync update` (it replaces `core/` only, never memory; commit as `chore(ledger): update core to <version>`); a MAJOR bump or no reachable source = note it and move on.
- If `.context_ledger/` exists, read it in this order:
  1. `.context_ledger/README.md` — the zone map (core = read-only protocol; memory = this project's data)
  2. `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` — who worked here before, with which model, and what they did (read the last 3–5 entries)
  3. `.context_ledger/memory/agents/roster.md` — the board by the door: who is in the office right now (each row: chosen name, codename `S<NNN>`, model, what they're on). **A live row you didn't write means a peer is here now** — see the check-in + mode rule below.
  4. `.context_ledger/memory/sessions/SUMMARY.md` — compressed session continuity (skim the last ~10 entries; if the file doesn't exist yet, skip — it's created by the first session that runs on 0.5.0+)
  5. `.context_ledger/memory/collaboration/README.md` — collaboration rules; if a shared session/issue is active, read its event files and status before claiming work.
  6. `.context_ledger/memory/workflows/gates.conf` — explicit commands and gate mode; initialize it if missing.
  7. `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/current.md` — in single-agent mode, is a task marked in-progress? If a prior session died mid-task, this is where you find out. In collaboration mode it is not a lock.
  8. `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md` — open items waiting for a session like this one
  9. `.context_ledger/memory/flaws/log.md` — known workflow/protocol traps — where the `.context_ledger` system itself misled a prior agent. **Don't re-hit a logged flaw.**
  10. `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` — known project traps (tool failures, flaky tests, env quirks). **Don't re-hit a logged trap.**
  11. `.context_ledger/memory/plans/decisions.md` — architectural decisions already made. **Don't relitigate them; don't "fix" code into violating them.**
  12. `.context_ledger/memory/overrides/rules.md` — project-local protocol adjustments. **Overrides beat this edition** (except secret-handling and append-only rules).
  13. `.context_ledger/memory/system/environments.md` + `.context_ledger/memory/system/ai-models.md` — environments and agents seen before
  14. `.context_ledger/memory/user/identity.md` + `.context_ledger/memory/user/preferences.md` — who the user is and how they like things done
  15. `.context_ledger/memory/workflows/active.md` — the workflow currently in force
  16. `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/` — local-only secret values available on this machine (never tracked; empty on a fresh clone). Note what's available — never print values.
- If `.context_ledger/` does NOT exist, bootstrap it now (see Bootstrap in the `.context_ledger/` section) and commit it: `chore(ledger): bootstrap .context_ledger/ (core <version>)`.
- **Migration:** if `docs/report/` contains prior reviews, move them: `git mv docs/report/*.md .context_ledger/memory/reviews/` in the same bootstrap commit. Leave a `docs/report/README.md` pointer saying reviews now live in `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/`.
- **Check in (every session — solo or collaboration).** Pick a real name you like (any human name — John, Ada, Kwame, Mei; unique in the group) and add or update your row in `.context_ledger/memory/agents/roster.md`: name, codename `S<NNN>` (your session number), model, and one line on what you're on. Then commit and push the row immediately, before any product work: `chore(ledger): <name> (<codename>) checks in — <task>`. This is the office registry — it is how the next agent through the door sees you are here, and the push is the sync point: if it forces a rebase, a peer checked in concurrently, so re-read the board. Present yourself by that name everywhere — events, session log, reports ("John (S427)", never "peer" or a bare id).
- **Check back in when work resumes after clock-out.** Clocking out (Step 15) vacates the board, but the session is not over until the user says so (Pitfall #30) — a supervisor follow-up after wrap-up means you have *left the office and come back*. Re-check in **before touching anything**: re-add your row to `agents/roster.md` and push it — `chore(ledger): <name> (<codename>) checks back in — <task>`. You are the same session, so keep the same name and codename `S<N>`; do **not** resume editing under a retired identity while your row is gone (peers see edits landing from someone not on the board), and do **not** open a second `Session N` — extend your existing session entry at the true close (Step 17). If you can foresee the follow-up, the cleaner move is to not clock out until the user actually releases the session.
- **Decide the mode from evidence, not from an empty board.** You are solo only if NO collaboration `session` + `issue` was declared AND the roster shows no live row you didn't write AND `tasks/current.md` is idle. A live roster row you didn't write means a peer is in the office: do not run a solo protocol — fetch and check for a `collab/<session-id>/coordination` branch and join its event trail; if none exists, declare a shared session/issue (mind the peer's "Doing" scope), take your own isolated clone/branch, and emit a `note` + `claim` before editing. If `tasks/current.md` shows a live session but the roster is empty (an old-core or crashed session), follow the stale-entry guidance on `current.md`; when it is genuinely live, do not start — one agent per project repo.
- In single-agent mode, set `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/current.md` to this session's task before starting work (overwrite — it holds one task at a time). In collaboration mode, do not use it as a lock: create an isolated branch/worktree, emit a `claim` event with the shared session/issue IDs, and inspect peer events first.

**Step 4 — Install dependencies**
- **Discover the package manager first** by checking which lockfile exists:
  - `bun.lock` → `bun install`
  - `package-lock.json` → `npm install`
  - `yarn.lock` → `yarn install`
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `pnpm install`
  - `poetry.lock` → `poetry install`
  - `requirements.txt` → `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `pyproject.toml` → `pip install -e ".[dev]"` (after creating a venv)
- **Python projects:** ALWAYS create a virtualenv first:
  ```bash
  cd backend  # or wherever pyproject.toml lives
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -e ".[dev]"
  ```
  Never install to system Python — it's locked down (`externally-managed-environment`).
- **Node projects with workspaces:** Install at the root, not per-package.
- If install fails, check for a `.nvmrc` / `.python-version` and switch versions.

**Step 5 — Read the docs**
Read these in order (use `offset`/`limit` for files >500 lines to avoid truncation):
1. `README.md` — what the project does, how to run it
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (if exists) — system design
3. `CHANGELOG.md` (top section only) — recent changes + conventions
4. `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/` — **prior agent reviews** (already skimmed in Step 3; now read the most recent one fully to avoid redoing work). Legacy location: `docs/report/`.
5. Any devlog in `docs/` — technical context

**Step 6 — Review recent commits**
```bash
git log --oneline -20
```
- Note the commit style (Conventional Commits? scope? body?).
- Note recent activity — what's been changing.
- Cross-check against `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` — commits by prior agents should have session entries.

**Step 7 — Fill in the Agent Discovery Phase** (see section below)
- This is mandatory, not optional busywork. It's the map for the session.
- `.context_ledger/` gives you a head start — verify what it claims rather than rediscovering from scratch, and correct it if the codebase has moved on.

**Step 8 — Run baseline health checks**
- **Discover commands from `package.json` scripts and `pyproject.toml` first** — don't guess:
  ```bash
  cat package.json | grep -A20 '"scripts"'
  cat backend/pyproject.toml | grep -A10 '\[tool.pytest'
  ```
- Typical commands:
  - Python: `ruff check .`, `pytest`, `mypy src`
  - TypeScript: `npx tsc -b`, `npx eslint .`, `npx vite build`
  - Rust: `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`
- Record the baseline: test count, lint error count, typecheck pass/fail.
- If the baseline is broken (tests failing, build broken), document it before touching anything. The agent is not responsible for pre-existing breakage.
- If a health-check command fails in a way `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` already documents, follow the logged workaround instead of rediscovering it.
- Check `.context_ledger/memory/system/environments.md` before guessing — a prior agent may have recorded verified commands for this environment.

### Phase 2: Review (no code changes)

**Step 9 — Review across focus areas**
- **If a Target is set** (not "general sweep"), scope Phase 2 to that target:
  - `refactor <path>` — review only the specified path/module and its callers
  - `fix <bug>` — reproduce the bug first (run the failing test, trace the code path), then review the surrounding code
  - `feature <description>` — review adjacent code for patterns to follow, note conventions
  - `review <area>` — review only the specified area (e.g., "UI only" → frontend components only)
  - Free text — interpret the target; if ambiguous, ask once in chat before proceeding
- **If Target is "general sweep"** (default), review across all focus areas (security, performance, UX, architecture, testing, docs):
  - Read the relevant code (use Grep/Glob to find files, Read with offset/limit for large files)
  - Note findings with severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Nice to Have)
  - For each finding: Description, Impact, Recommendation
- **Deep-scan methodology:** when you find a bug, grep for the same pattern across the whole codebase. Don't fix one instance — fix all instances in one commit.
- Check `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/` for prior findings — don't re-report what's already fixed.
- Check `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md` — prior agents may have already scoped items you're about to "discover."
- Check `.context_ledger/memory/plans/decisions.md` before flagging something as an architecture problem — it may be a documented, deliberate decision.

### Phase 3: Fix (code changes)

**Step 10 — Apply fixes per the findings handling policy**
- **If a Target is set** (not "general sweep"), scope Phase 3 to that target:
  - `refactor <path>` — refactor only the specified path/module; don't fix unrelated issues found elsewhere (backlog them)
  - `fix <bug>` — fix the bug AND ship a regression test; don't fix unrelated issues found nearby (backlog them)
  - `feature <description>` — implement the feature following patterns noted in Phase 2; run tests after each logical change
  - `review <area>` — no Phase 3 (review-only target); skip to Step 12 (report)
  - Free text — fix what the target implies; backlog anything unrelated
- **If Target is "general sweep"** (default), apply all safe fixes found in Phase 2.
- "Fix safe issues" = typos, doc mismatches, missing validation, dark-mode gaps, type annotations, DRY refactors, accessibility, SSRF hardening, perf optimizations with no behavior change.
- "Flag architectural changes" = provider config consolidation, module decomposition, theming strategy, new abstractions. Document these in the report and `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md` but don't implement without explicit approval.
- Order fixes by: security first, then bugs, then improvements, then docs.

**Step 11 — Commit each fix**
- One logical change per commit (per the commit granularity policy).
- **Commit granularity examples:**
  - ✅ `fix(security): close SSRF redirect bypass` — 1 commit (one bug, one fix)
  - ✅ `docs: add .env.example + fix README typo` — 1 commit (both are doc fixes, same concern)
  - ❌ `fix(security): SSRF + feat(api): key validation + docs: README` — 3 concerns in 1 commit. Split into 3.
  - ✅ `refactor(core): extract human_size to shared utils` — 1 commit (one refactor across multiple files)
- Conventional Commits with scope: `fix(security): ...`, `feat(api): ...`, `docs: ...`
- `.context_ledger/` updates use their own prefix: `chore(ledger): ...` — they are neither features nor fixes.
- Commit message format: first line ≤72 chars, blank line, body explaining why (not what).
- **Quality gates before each commit** (see Quality Gates section).
- **If there's nothing to fix:** skip to Step 13 (report). A clean codebase is a valid outcome — write a report saying "baseline healthy, no findings."

**Step 12 — Push to remote**
- The remote URL was stripped of the token in Step 2. To push, temporarily re-add it:
  ```bash
  # Re-set URL with token for push
  git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:${GIT_TOKEN}@github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>.git"
  git pull --ff-only  # in case another agent pushed
  git push origin main
  # IMMEDIATELY strip the token again so it's not in .git/config between pushes
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>.git
  ```
- **Collaboration mode:** push the isolated `collab/<session-id>/<agent-id>` branch, not the shared integration branch. Rebase/pull before publishing each event or product commit. If product branches conflict at integration, the involved agents compare the alternatives and record an agreement before resolving; never force-overwrite a peer.
- If push is rejected (non-fast-forward), pull, resolve conflicts, and push again. `.context_ledger/` event files merge by keeping both files; do not edit an existing event to resolve a conflict.
- **If a fix breaks tests:** either fix the test or revert the change. Do NOT push broken tests. If you can't resolve it in 2 attempts, revert and document the issue in the report and `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md`.

### Phase 4: Report

**Step 13 — Write the report**
- Save to `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md` in the repo (use today's date; create the directory if missing). If a report for today already exists, suffix the new one: `YYYY-MM-DD-review-2.md` (per `reviews/README.md`). Role overlays use their own filename (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-security-review.md` — see `roles/README.md`).
- Structure: Executive Summary → Discovery Phase → Baseline Health → Findings (by severity) → Fixes Applied → Open Items → Recommended Next Steps.
- **Even if no findings:** write a report saying "baseline healthy, no findings" — the next agent needs to know the review happened.
- Commit (`docs(review): ...` or the project's convention) and push (same push workflow as Step 12).

**Step 14 — Update CHANGELOG**
- If the project has a `CHANGELOG.md`, add entries for all behavior-changing fixes under `[Unreleased]`.
- Use the project's existing changelog format (Keep a Changelog, etc.).
- Plain language for public changelogs (grandmother test). Technical detail goes in the report.
- Commit and push.

### Phase 5: Update `.context_ledger/` (agent memory)

> These three steps are how the next agent — on any machine, any model —
> picks up exactly where you left off. They are **mandatory**, even for
> a session with no findings. Commit them together or separately with
> the `chore(ledger):` prefix, and push.

**Step 15 — Update `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/`**
- In single-agent mode, clear `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/current.md` — mark the session's task done (or blocked, with the blocker). In collaboration mode, leave peers' task state untouched and emit a `release` or `handoff` event for each claimed scope.
- **Clock out — when you are actually leaving.** Remove your row from `.context_ledger/memory/agents/roster.md` in this closing memory commit — the board shows who is in the office *now*, and a row left behind sends the next agent hunting for a peer who has left. Your visit is still on record: the session entry and git history keep it. `ledger-mem check` warns if a session entry was appended while your row still claims the office. **But leaving the board and finishing a unit of work are not the same event.** The session is not over until the user releases it (Pitfall #30), so if you expect a follow-up, keep your row live and clock out later. If you *did* clock out and the user brings more work, you have left and returned: **check back in first** (see the check-in rule above) — re-add your row before any edit, under the same name and codename, and extend rather than duplicate your Step 17 entry.
- Append every open item you couldn't finish to `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md` (append-only — never delete or reorder existing entries). Include enough context that a fresh agent can act on the item without this session's chat history.
- If this session completed an existing backlog item, check it off (`- [x]`) and note the session/commit — don't remove the line.

**Step 16 — Update `.context_ledger/memory/system/` + `.context_ledger/memory/user/` + `.context_ledger/memory/plans/`**
- `.context_ledger/memory/system/environments.md`: add/update the block for the environment you ran on (sandbox/OS, runtime versions, package manager, anything the next agent needs to reproduce your setup). Refresh its last-verified date and record the commands you verified work (install / test / lint / dev).
- `.context_ledger/memory/system/ai-models.md`: update the row for your **(agent, model)** — bump the sessions count and last-seen date. If a row for your pair already exists, **edit it in place; do not add a second row** (a new row is only for a genuinely new agent+model pair). Add an Observations bullet for any concrete capability or limit this session demonstrated (yours or a prior agent's). Then run `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-mem check` (Windows: `.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-mem.cmd check`) — it fails if a registry has a duplicated key.
- `.context_ledger/memory/user/preferences.md`: record every standing preference this session revealed — corrections the user gave, patterns they approved, things they stated — with provenance + date, per the file's learning rules. One-off instructions don't count. Skip if none.
- `.context_ledger/memory/plans/decisions.md`: append an ADR-style entry for every architectural decision made or confirmed this session (context → decision → consequences). Skip if none.

**Step 17 — Log the session**
- Append a session entry to `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` (append-only). This is the permanent record: date, agent, model, platform, task, commits (count + SHA range), outcome, open items. Include the `Notes:` line — set to the `memory/sessions/<date>-<N>/notes.md` path if you created notes, or "none". In collaboration mode also record the shared session/issue IDs, event IDs, branch, and agreement/release references. **Do not confuse this with SUMMARY.md: this file gets the full ~7-line entry; SUMMARY.md gets ONE line.**
- **One entry per codename `S<N>` — even across a resume.** If the user reopened the session after you already logged it, do **not** append a second `Session N`: edit your existing entry in place (extend the commit range, update the outcome and open items). A duplicate `Session N` splits one session across two records and makes the duty log lie about who did what; `ledger-mem check` warns when it sees one.
- Append a one-line summary to `.context_ledger/memory/sessions/SUMMARY.md`. This is the prunable compressed continuity (unlike `agents/sessions.md` which is append-only forever). Format: date, agent, model, one-line outcome, and a key decision/discovery if any. **One line only — do not write the full session entry here.**
- **Context Promotion:** if you created a `memory/sessions/<date>-<N>/notes.md` for this session, evaluate its contents before closing: *"Does anything in these notes need to survive beyond this session?"*
  - **Durable facts → promote.** Distill and write them into their proper persistent domain: an architectural insight → `plans/decisions.md` (ADR); a new constraint or workaround → `inefficiencies/log.md`; a new backlog item → `tasks/backlog.md`; a user preference discovered → `user/preferences.md`; a protocol friction → `flaws/log.md`. Promotion is selective — the goal is not to copy the notes; it is to move durable knowledge to where future agents will find it without reading session history. **The invariant: permanent context must never depend exclusively on an individual session.** A durable fact lives in its domain file, not only in a session directory — so deleting the session cannot delete the knowledge.
  - **Session-scoped detail → stays.** Research notes, attempted approaches, dead ends, intermediate reasoning — these remain in the notes file. A future agent can retrieve them selectively if the detail is needed.
  - **Nothing worth keeping → no notes file needed.** A trivial session (typo fix, one-line config) that produced no research or exploration needs no `memory/sessions/` directory at all — the summary line in `agents/sessions.md` is the entire record.
  - After promotion, you may delete `notes.md` if its raw history is no longer useful. The summary line in `agents/sessions.md` is the permanent record that the session happened.
- **SUMMARY.md pruning:** if `memory/sessions/SUMMARY.md` exceeds ~40 lines, prune entries older than the last 10. Distill any un-promoted key facts from pruned entries into the durable logs first. SUMMARY.md is prunable — never let it become another giant append-only history file. A pruned summary line MUST have a corresponding permanent entry in `agents/sessions.md`.
- **Durable-log archiving:** `flaws/log.md` and `inefficiencies/log.md` are append-only, grow forever, and are read at startup. Once an entry is explicitly marked `RESOLVED` / `superseded` / fixed, it is cold history — move it **verbatim** (no edits) into a companion `flaws/archive.md` / `inefficiencies/archive.md`. Startup then reads only the active log; the archive stays in git, grep-able. This is a manual cut-and-paste, never automatic. Run `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-mem prune` (Windows: the `.ps1`) to see how large each log is and which entries are archive-eligible (`--list` names them). **Only an explicit closed marker makes an entry eligible — age alone never does.** An unresolved flaw stays in the active log; it's a live trap the next agent must see.
- **Session grouping:** session history is grouped, not an endless stream. The current group's registry (`agents/sessions.md`) and summaries (`sessions/SUMMARY.md`) live in `memory/`; closed groups live in `.context_ledger/history/` (readable) and `.context_ledger/archive/` (zipped) and are **never read at session start**. When the group reaches `group_size` sessions (default 20) or hits a milestone, run `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-history close` (Windows: the `.ps1`) — a dry run prints the promotion checklist and plan; `--confirm` consolidates the group into `history/`, starts a fresh group, and rolls the oldest readable group into `archive/`. **Before closing, promote every open thread into its durable domain file** (`backlog.md`, `decisions.md`, `inefficiencies/log.md`, `flaws/log.md`, `user/preferences.md`) — the new group starts clean with no implicit carryover. `ledger-history gc --confirm` deletes the oldest `archive/` tarballs over the cap (git-recoverable). Run `ledger-history status` to see whether a close or gc is due.
- **Session notes heuristic:** create a `memory/sessions/<date>-<N>/notes.md` if your session involved any of: more than one attempted approach, external research, a decision made after considering alternatives, a dead end you'd want the next agent to know about, or exploration that produced useful negative results. A truly trivial session (typo fix, one-line config change, docs correction with no research) needs no notes file.
- Append every inefficiency you hit to `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` (append-only): tool failures, flaky tests, misleading docs, commands that didn't work as documented, time wasted rediscovering something `.context_ledger/` should have told you. **Be honest — this log is how the protocol improves.** An empty inefficiency entry ("none this session") is valid only if literally nothing slowed you down.
- Append every workflow/protocol flaw to `.context_ledger/memory/flaws/log.md` (append-only): ambiguous rules, missing steps, confusing templates — friction caused by the `.context_ledger` system itself, not the project. Suggest a concrete package fix in each entry (see `flaws/README.md`).
- Commit (`chore(ledger): log session YYYY-MM-DD`) and push.

### Phase 6: Wrap up

**Step 18 — Final summary in chat**
- One-paragraph summary of what was done.
- Commits made (count + SHA range).
- Key findings by severity.
- Open items for the next session (mirroring `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md`).
- Remind the user to rotate the PAT.

**Step 19 — Unset the PAT**
```bash
unset GIT_TOKEN
rm -f .context_ledger/memory/secrets/github-pat   # if you stored it there in Step 1
```
- Verify it's gone: `echo "${GIT_TOKEN}"` should print empty.
- This is the LAST step. Once unset, no more pushes are possible — make sure Steps 15–17 were committed and pushed first.

## The `.context_ledger/` Directory (AGENT MEMORY — TRAVELS WITH THE REPO)

> `.context_ledger/` is the project's institutional memory for AI agents. It is
> **committed to git**, so every agent on every machine pulls the same
> context: who worked on what, on which system, with which model, what's
> open, what's been decided, and what went wrong before. The repo's docs
> (`README`, `docs/`) describe the *product*; `.context_ledger/` describes the
> *process*.

```

**The zone rule is absolute: never write under `.context_ledger/core/`.** It is
a checksummed copy of the protocol package, replaced only as a whole
tree by `ledger-sync update`. A protocol improvement belongs in
`memory/flaws/log.md` (it flows to the package and comes back in a core
release) — never patched into the vendored copy.

Every `memory/` file agents write to carries its entry template in an
HTML comment — at the top of the file itself, or in its directory's
README (`reviews/`, `secrets/`). Follow it, don't invent formats. The
authoritative spec for every file (mode, scope, ownership) is
`.context_ledger/core/schemas/ledger-schema.md`.

### What goes where (quick reference)

| You have... | Write it to... | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| A review/finding about the codebase | `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md` | new file per session |
| An open item you can't finish now | `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md` | append |
| The task you're starting/finishing | `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/current.md` | overwrite |
| An architectural decision | `.context_ledger/memory/plans/decisions.md` | append (ADR) |
| Project friction (tool failure, flaky test, env quirk, dependency pain) | `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` | append |
| Workflow/protocol friction (ambiguous rule, missing step, confusing template) | `.context_ledger/memory/flaws/log.md` | append |
| Your session summary (who/what/model/commits) | `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` | append |
| Facts about the machine/sandbox you ran on | `.context_ledger/memory/system/environments.md` | update |
| Which agent + model you are | `.context_ledger/memory/system/ai-models.md` | update |
| Something you learned about the user | `.context_ledger/memory/user/preferences.md` | update |
| A change to the workflow itself | `.context_ledger/memory/workflows/active.md` | update |
| Compressed session continuity | `.context_ledger/memory/sessions/SUMMARY.md` | update-in-place (entries are removable) |
| Session-scoped detail (research, dead ends, exploration) | `.context_ledger/memory/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-N/notes.md` | append while active; deletable after promotion |
| A secret value the agent needs on this machine | `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/<slug>` | local-only — never committed |
| A project-local exception to this protocol | `.context_ledger/memory/overrides/rules.md` | update |
| A learning about this protocol itself | `.context_ledger/memory/flaws/log.md` — never edit `core/` | append (flows to the package) |

### Rules

1. **Append-only logs are append-only.** `sessions.md`, `inefficiencies/log.md`, `backlog.md`, and `decisions.md` never lose entries. If a past entry was wrong, append a correction referencing it — don't erase history.
2. **No secrets in tracked files.** `.context_ledger/` is committed to git. Record env var *names* and where secrets live in shared files — never values. Values the agent needs live only in `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/`, whose own `.gitignore` keeps them out of the repo (rules in its README). No PATs, API keys, or connection strings anywhere else.
3. **`chore(ledger):` commit prefix.** Context updates are not features or fixes. Keep them out of the changelog. One exception: review reports in `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/` commit as `docs(review):` (Step 13) — they're a deliverable, not bookkeeping.
4. **Friction logging is mandatory — and split by surface.** Project friction goes in `inefficiencies/log.md`; workflow/protocol friction goes in `flaws/log.md` (see `flaws/README.md` for the split, and how flaws flow back to the package repo). Both honest, every session. Wasted time you don't log is time the next agent wastes again.
5. **Verify before trusting.** `.context_ledger/` reflects what was true when written. If it contradicts the codebase, the codebase wins — fix the `.context_ledger/` entry (append a correction).
6. **Small and current beats big and stale.** Session entries are ~10 lines, not transcripts. Reports carry the detail.
7. **Session data is disposable.** Detailed session notes (`memory/sessions/`) may be deleted when no longer useful. The compact summary in `memory/sessions/SUMMARY.md` is prunable; the formal registry in `agents/sessions.md` is the permanent record. Before deleting any session data, promote durable facts to their persistent domain — **permanent context must never depend exclusively on an individual session.**

### Entry templates

**`.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md`** (append one per session):

```

### Bootstrap (first session in a repo without `.context_ledger/`)

Bootstrap needs a clone of the protocol package on disk **once** — the
only time any session touches the package directly. After it, the
protocol lives inside the project and travels with every clone.

1. **Preferred — let the tool do it.** From the package clone:
   `sh <package>/core/bin/ledger-sync bootstrap <repo>` — it vendors
   `core/` into `.context_ledger/core/`, copies the memory skeleton to
   `.context_ledger/memory/`, seeds `.context_ledger/README.md`, `.context_ledger/kickoff.md`,
   and the root `AGENTS.md`, and writes `memory/core.lock`.
2. **Manual fallback (no package on disk):** you cannot vendor core by
   hand from memory — say so, and ask the user for the package (a clone
   or an unpacked `context-X.Y.Z` archive). Never reconstruct protocol
   files from recall; a half-remembered core is worse than none.
3. **Guard against the classic wrong copies** — all of these must come back empty:
   `ls .context_ledger/.git .context_ledger/core/core .context_ledger/memory/memory 2>/dev/null` —
   any output means a nested clone or a double-copied tree; delete `.context_ledger/` and redo step 1.
4. Fill `memory/user/identity.md` and `memory/user/preferences.md` from Pre-Flight, `memory/workflows/active.md` from Session Parameters (protocol recorded "by agent type", naming BOTH editions), and add your row to `memory/system/ai-models.md`. Then fill the generated `.context_ledger/kickoff.md`'s Project Facts per its HTML-comment rules (verified facts beat Pre-Flight; no session parameters; no secrets) and `AGENTS.md`'s `<PROJECT_NAME>` — those two are the entry points for every future session on this repo.
5. **Migrate:** `git mv docs/report/*.md .context_ledger/memory/reviews/` if prior reviews exist; leave a pointer README behind.
6. Commit everything as one `chore(ledger): bootstrap .context_ledger/ (core <version>)` and push.

## Agent Discovery Phase (AGENT FILLS THIS IN DURING STEP 7)

> After cloning the repo and reading `.context_ledger/`, explore and fill in every
> field below. Do not leave placeholders. This section becomes the project's
> quick-reference card for the rest of the session. If something doesn't
> apply, write "N/A" with a one-line reason. `.context_ledger/` may pre-answer many
> fields — verify against the code, don't copy blindly.

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** _(discover from `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)_
- **Language:** _(discover from config files and file extensions)_
- **Database + ORM/Driver:** _(discover from schema files, migrations, or connection code)_
- **Authentication:** _(discover from auth lib imports — NextAuth, Clerk, Passport, Devise, etc.)_
- **Media/Storage:** _(discover from upload routes, env vars, or storage SDK imports)_
- **Styling:** _(discover from `tailwind.config`, `postcss.config`, CSS framework imports)_
- **State management:** _(discover from imports — Zustand, Redux, MobX, Context, etc.)_
- **Package manager:** _(discover from which lockfile exists: `bun.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `poetry.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, etc.)_
- **Deployment target:** _(discover from `vercel.json`, `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, CI config, or build scripts)_

### Project Structure
- **App entry / shell:** _(discover — main layout, app component, or route root)_
- **API / backend routes:** _(discover — e.g., `src/app/api/*`, `routes/`, `app/Http/Controllers/`)_
- **Frontend components:** _(discover — e.g., `src/components/*`, `app/components/`)_
- **Shared libraries:** _(discover — e.g., `src/lib/*`, `lib/`, `utils/`)_
- **Database schema/migrations:** _(discover — e.g., `prisma/`, `db/migrate/`, `migrations/`)_
- **UI primitives:** _(discover — e.g., shadcn `components/ui/`, a design system folder — note if they shouldn't be edited directly)_

### Documentation Files
- **README:** _(read and note what it covers)_
- **Architecture doc:** _(find and note the path if it exists)_
- **Changelog:** _(find and note the path if it exists)_
- **Devlog / technical log:** _(find and note the path if it exists)_
- **Prior review:** _(check `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/` first, then legacy `docs/report/` — note path + date of most recent)_
- **Env example:** _(find `.env.example` and note required vs. optional vars)_

### Conventions Discovered
- **Commit style:** _(read `git log --oneline -20` — Conventional Commits? scope? body? co-authors?)_
- **Versioning:** _(read the changelog or package manifest — semver? calver? patch/minor/major thresholds?)_
- **Changelog rules:** _(read the top of the changelog — public? non-technical only? dual changelog+devlog?)_
- **Theming:** _(does the project support multiple themes? Or is it single-theme? Check `globals.css`, `tailwind.config`, and whether a `.dark` class is ever applied to `<html>`.)_
- **Testing:** _(test runner? framework? where do tests live? coverage?)_
- **Linting/formatting:** _(ESLint/Prettier/Black/Rustfmt config? custom rules? typecheck clean?)_

### Prior Agent Context (from `.context_ledger/`)
- **Last session:** _(date, agent, model, outcome — from `agents/sessions.md`)_
- **Open backlog items:** _(count + the ones relevant to this session — from `tasks/backlog.md`)_
- **Known traps:** _(from `inefficiencies/log.md` — anything that will bite this session)_
- **Standing decisions:** _(from `plans/decisions.md` — anything constraining this session's fixes)_

### Test Accounts
- _(Use accounts provided by the user, or discover from seed scripts. If the app is local-only with no auth, write "N/A — local-only app, no authentication".)_

---

## Git Workflow

### Core rules
1. **Work directly on `main`** unless the project uses a branch-based workflow (discover from git history).
2. **Commit frequently** — one logical change per commit. Don't accumulate unrelated changes.
3. **Push after every commit** (per push policy) — don't let commits pile up locally.
4. **Follow Conventional Commits** with scope if the project uses one: `fix(auth):`, `feat(api):`, `docs:`. Context updates use `chore(ledger):`.
5. **Always pull before pushing** — `git pull --ff-only`. Other agents may have pushed.
6. **Never force-push without `--force-with-lease`.**
7. **Pull before inspecting another agent's work.** If the user references work you haven't seen ("check what the session did," "pull the changes," "look at what Copilot did"), fetch first: `git fetch origin`. If remote is ahead, pull before inspecting. Your local state is stale the moment another agent pushes — don't `git show` or `git log` on commits you didn't make until you've confirmed local matches remote.

### Push workflow (PAT-protected repos)

> The remote URL is stripped of the token after cloning (Step 2). To push,
> temporarily re-add the token, push, then strip it again. This keeps the
> token out of `.git/config` on disk between pushes.

```bash
# Before push: re-add token to URL
git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:${GIT_TOKEN}@github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>.git"
git pull --ff-only
git push origin main
# After push: strip token from URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>.git
```

### When you make a mistake
1. **Assess**: is it the latest commit? Has anyone else pulled it?
2. **Reset locally**: `git reset --hard <sha-before-the-mistake>`
3. **Force-push**: `git push --force-with-lease origin main`
4. **Own it**: explain what happened in the report and chat summary.
5. **Learn from it**: log it in `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` (and the worklog) if it reveals a workflow gap.

### The "don't rubber-stamp" rule
If the Pre-Flight section contains a significant decision (major version bump, "production release" declaration, breaking change), **flag it in the report** before executing. Don't ask mid-workflow — document the concern and proceed with the safer option, noting the concern for the user to review post-session.

---

## Changelog & Documentation Conventions

> Discover the project's conventions and respect them. Read the top of each doc file for project-specific notices.

### If the project has a public changelog
- **Check if it's rendered publicly** (look for a `/changelog` route, marketing page, docs site).
- **If public: plain language only.** Grandmother test: would a non-technical user understand this sentence?
- **NEVER include in a public changelog:** file names, component names, API routes, DB/ORM details, library names, env var names, security vulnerability mechanics, commit hashes, PR numbers.
- **Write the changelog entry SECOND** — after the report entry.
- **`.context_ledger/` updates never go in the changelog** — they're process, not product.

### Versioning
- Read the changelog or package manifest: semver? calver?
- **Default:** patch for fixes/small UI, minor for new features, major for breaking changes.
- **Never renumber released versions** — breaks tags and links.
- Update the `[Unreleased]` comparison link when adding a new version.

---

## Working Philosophy

Treat this as a production project. Think like an owner, not a contractor.

- **Do work, don't just talk about work.** Ship commits, not essays.
- **Don't blindly follow instructions.** Question assumptions — including the user's. If something seems off, document the concern in the report and proceed with the safer option.
- **Preserve existing functionality** unless a change is explicitly intended.
- **Follow existing conventions** unless there's a compelling reason to improve them.
- **Explain architectural decisions** in commit messages, the report, and `.context_ledger/memory/plans/decisions.md`.

### Multi-agent awareness
- **Read `.context_ledger/` before anything else** (Step 3) — it's the shared brain across agents, machines, and models.
- **Check `.context_ledger/memory/agents/roster.md` before concluding you're alone** — an empty board is only trustworthy right after you verify it; a live row you didn't write means a peer is here now (declare or join a session; never run a solo protocol into a peer).
- **Check in and push the row before product work** — presence must be visible to peers in real time, not at wrap-up.
- **Always pull before starting work** and after every commit.
- **Check `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/`** for prior agent reviews — don't redo work that's already done.
- **Check `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/current.md`** — in single-agent mode, if another agent marked a task in-progress recently, don't collide with it; in collaboration mode, use the shared session/issue event trail and claims instead, and note any overlap in your session entry.
- **Don't assume your local state matches remote.** Check with `git fetch` and `git log HEAD..origin/main`.
- **If your working tree has unexpected changes**, check the roster and collaboration events first to attribute them — they may be a peer's claim, not drift. If they are truly unattributed, the remote moved ahead: hard-sync `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main` (after stashing in-progress work).

## Code Review Checklist

Evaluate:
- Architecture, Maintainability, Readability, Modularity
- Code duplication, SOLID principles, Design patterns
- Error handling, Logging, Testing coverage
- Configuration management, Input validation
- Authorization checks (every mutation checks ownership; every admin route is gated)
- Race conditions (especially on counters)
- Pagination hardening (guard against negative/NaN/huge values)
- Technical debt

**Deep-scan methodology:** when you find a bug, grep for the same pattern across the whole codebase. Fix all instances in one commit.

---

## Functional Testing

> Only if a live app is available (check the "Live Application" field — if "N/A", skip and note it in the report).

Test normal workflows and edge cases. Think like: end user, admin, developer, QA, power user, first-time visitor. Verify existing functionality before modifying it. Reproduce bugs before fixing them.

---

## UX / UI Review

### Reference-driven design
When the user provides screenshots, use vision analysis to compare precisely — measure layout, column counts, card widths, spacing.

### Evaluate:
- Navigation, Discoverability, Visual hierarchy
- Accessibility (keyboard nav, focus indicators, ARIA labels, color contrast)
- Typography, Spacing, Color consistency
- Responsiveness (360px, 768px, 1280px)
- Empty states, Loading states, Error messages
- Mobile-specific issues (iOS Safari quirks, touch targets, safe-area insets)

### Dark mode / theme completeness (ONLY if the project supports multiple themes)

> **First, determine if the project supports theming.** Check:
> 1. Does `globals.css` define both light (`:root`) and dark (`.dark`) variables?
> 2. Is `.dark` ever applied to `<html>` (toggle, `prefers-color-scheme`, hardcoded)?
> 3. Do components use `dark:` variants or theme-aware CSS variables?
>
> **If single-theme** (dark-only, light-only): skip this section. Note "single-theme" in the report. **If the project has light + dark variables but never applies `.dark`**: that's a finding (theming infrastructure exists but is inactive) — flag it, don't try to "fix" every component.

**If multi-theme:** Every light-mode color class needs a `dark:` variant (except intentional theme-agnostic surfaces). Scan all components, fix every instance, document false positives.

---

## Performance Review

Look for:
- Slow rendering, Expensive computations
- N+1 queries, Missing indexes, Unbounded result sets
- Excessive API calls, No caching
- Large bundle sizes
- Unnecessary re-renders (missing `useMemo`/`useCallback`, wrong deps)
- Memory leaks (event listeners not cleaned up, intervals not cleared)
- Image optimization, Lazy loading, CDN caching
- Algorithmic complexity (e.g., `Array.find()` inside a sort → use Map)

Implement safe optimizations. Always typecheck before committing.

---

## Security Review

Evaluate:
- Authentication, Authorization (every route checks auth; every mutation checks ownership)
- Input validation (length limits, type checks, format validation)
- Output encoding (never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization)
- Sensitive data exposure (never serialize password hashes; never leak internals in errors)
- API security (rate limiting on auth, upload, mutation routes)
- File uploads (content-type allowlist, max size, URL protocol validation)
- **SSRF protection** (if the project fetches URLs: check for redirect-following bypass, private IP filtering, metadata endpoint blocking)
- Secrets management (PAT in env var only; `.env*` in `.gitignore`; API keys stored with `0600` perms; **no secret values in tracked `.context_ledger/` files — values only in `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/`**)
- Session handling
- Dependency vulnerabilities (check audit tools — verify against actual installed versions)

**Critical:** never put security vulnerability mechanics in a public changelog — only in the internal report.

---

## Documentation

- Keep README current. Document architectural decisions, new features, setup changes.
- Follow the project's changelog/devlog system for every behavior-changing commit.

### Review reports

Place review reports in `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/` in the repo (create the directory if it doesn't exist). Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-review.md` so they sort chronologically; role overlays use `YYYY-MM-DD-<role>-review.md`. The next agent checks this directory first — don't skip writing one. (Legacy location `docs/report/` — migrate on first session, per the `.context_ledger/` Bootstrap rules.)

---

## Development Standards

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- One responsibility per function.
- DRY — use shared helpers, don't reinvent.
- Comment the *why*, not the *what*.
- Handle errors gracefully — consistent error envelope per API route.
- Validate all input at the API boundary.
- Check authorization on every mutation.

---

## Screenshots

Capture only when they help explain an issue. When the user provides screenshots:
1. Analyze with vision — don't guess.
2. If competitor references, compare side-by-side. Measure precisely.
3. Save reference analysis, then delete the screenshots after.

Delete temporary files once no longer needed.

---

## Reporting

For each issue: Severity, Description, Impact, Recommendation, Status, Related commit.

Severities: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Nice to Have.

Save to `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md`. Commit and push it.

---

## Communication

- Be proactive — propose improvements not explicitly requested.
- Explain significant technical decisions in the report.
- Document assumptions when certainty isn't possible.
- A user correction is a standing signal, not just a one-off fix — record it in `.context_ledger/memory/user/preferences.md` at Step 16 so the user never gives the same correction twice.
- After 2 consecutive tool-call timeouts, tell the user to restart the session — and log the timeouts in `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` first if you can.

---

## Worklog Protocol

All agents in this sandbox share a single worklog at **`/home/z/my-project/worklog.md`** (outside the repo — the agent sandbox).

> **Scope note:** the sandbox worklog coordinates agents *within one sandbox*
> and does not travel with the repo. The durable, cross-machine session record
> is `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` (Step 17) — write both. The worklog can be
> chatty and process-heavy; the session entry is the ~10-line distillation.

### When to write:
- After completing a logical unit of work (one or more commits)
- Before starting work, read previous entries for context

### Format:
```markdown
---
Task ID: <number>
Agent: <agent name>
Task: <what you were asked to do>

Work Log:
- <concrete step 1>
- <concrete step 2>

Stage Summary:
- <key results / decisions / artifacts>
- <open items flagged for later>
```

Append-only. Never overwrite. Start each section with `---`.

> The worklog (agent process) is separate from the report (project findings). Both are useful for the next agent.

---

## Quality Gates (Before Every Commit)

- [ ] Typecheck passes with 0 errors
- [ ] Linter/formatter passes on changed files
- [ ] Test suite passes (or new failures are pre-existing and documented)
- [ ] If behavior changed: changelog entry added
- [ ] If behavior changed: devlog/report entry added
- [ ] If behavior changed: version bumped (if the project versions that way)
- [ ] Commit message follows the project's commit style (`chore(ledger):` for `.context_ledger/` updates)
- [ ] No secrets in the diff (scan `git diff` — no PAT, API keys, passwords; doubly so for `.context_ledger/` files); `git status` must show nothing from `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/`
- [ ] Pushed to origin (per push policy)

### End-of-session gates (before Step 19 unsets the PAT)

- [ ] `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/current.md` cleared, open items appended to `backlog.md` (Step 15) in single-agent mode; collaboration mode releases/handoffs each claim without clearing a peer's task
- [ ] Roster row removed (clocked out) in `.context_ledger/memory/agents/roster.md` (Step 15)
- [ ] `.context_ledger/memory/system/` + `.context_ledger/memory/user/` + `.context_ledger/memory/plans/` updated (Step 16)
- [ ] Session entry in `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md` + inefficiencies logged (Step 17)
- [ ] All `chore(ledger):` commits pushed

---

## Common Pitfalls (Learned the Hard Way)

1. **Don't put the PAT in this file** — the upload pipeline redacts secrets. Paste it in chat instead.
2. **Don't use the wrong package manager** — discover the authoritative lockfile. A stray `npm install` in a bun project recreates a stale lockfile.
3. **Don't install Python deps to system Python** — always use a venv (`python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`). System Python is locked down.
4. **Don't put technical detail in a public changelog** — grandmother test.
5. **Don't skip the devlog/report entry** — technical detail must be preserved.
6. **Don't rubber-stamp version bumps** — flag major versions or "production release" in the report.
7. **Don't forget to pull** — other agents may have pushed while you were working.
8. **Don't fix one instance of a bug** — deep-scan for the same pattern across the codebase.
9. **Don't leave temporary files** — delete screenshots and temp scripts after use.
10. **Don't talk instead of doing** — ship commits, not essays.
11. **Don't assume theming is incomplete** — first check if the project supports multiple themes. If dark-only by design, missing `dark:` variants may be intentional.
12. **Don't forget the `[Unreleased]` link update** — update the comparison link at the bottom of the changelog when adding a new version.
13. **Don't hardcode secrets** — PATs as transient env vars, reference as `${GIT_TOKEN}`, strip from `.git/config` after cloning and after each push.
14. **Don't skip the discovery phase** — the Agent Discovery Phase section is your map.
15. **Don't skip writing a report** — the next agent needs it. Put it in `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md`.
16. **Don't trust `follow_redirects=True` in HTTP clients** — SSRF protection must re-validate redirect targets. A 302 to `169.254.169.254` bypasses protection that only checks the initial URL.
17. **Don't guess lint/typecheck commands** — read `package.json` scripts and `pyproject.toml` `[tool.*]` sections first. `tsc -b` ≠ `tsc --noEmit`; `npx eslint .` ≠ `npm run lint`.
18. **Don't read huge files in one shot** — files >500 lines get truncated. Use `Read` with `offset`/`limit`, or `Grep` to find the relevant section first.
19. **Don't forget to strip the token after push** — the push workflow re-adds the token to the remote URL; strip it immediately after so it's not persisted in `.git/config`.
20. **Don't skip reading `.context_ledger/` (Step 3)** — rediscovering what a prior agent already documented is the #1 logged inefficiency. Read first, verify second, work third.
21. **Don't put secret values in tracked `.context_ledger/` files** — the directory is committed to git. Values belong only in `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/` (self-gitignored — verify with `git check-ignore` before writing); everywhere else, names and locations only.
22. **Don't edit append-only logs** — `sessions.md`, `inefficiencies/log.md`, `backlog.md`, `decisions.md` grow by appending. Wrong entries get appended corrections, not deletions.
23. **Don't unset the PAT before the `.context_ledger/` updates are pushed** — Steps 15–17 need one final push; Step 19 comes last.
24. **Don't skip the inefficiency log because the session went "fine"** — friction you absorbed silently is friction the next agent hits blind.
25. **Don't guess your own model version** — system prompts often don't state it, and guesses propagate across sessions as wrong data. If the user filled in Pre-Flight's Agent Identity, copy it verbatim. If not, ask once in chat. If the user doesn't know, record `unknown` — never fabricate a version number.
26. **Don't skip the Exit checklist** — a session is not done until every box in the Session Lifecycle → EXIT section is checked. If the user has to remind you to commit or push, the protocol failed. Log it as a flaw.
27. **Don't treat `workflows/active.md` as documentation** — it's a binding instruction. After reading it, immediately load the protocol it references. Don't proceed with other tool use until the protocol is loaded.
28. **Don't treat any task as "too small for Phase 1"** — even a one-line `.context_ledger/` edit requires Steps 1–8 first. Skipping Phase 1 is the most common protocol violation.
29. **Don't include secret values in "rotate this" reminders** — the Exit checklist says to remind the user to rotate the PAT. The reminder is a nudge ("Rotate the PAT"), not a re-display ("Rotate the PAT: `github_pat_...`"). Including the value leaks it into the chat transcript, which may be logged or shared. Reference the token by its last 4 characters at most, never the full value. This applies to all secrets, not just the PAT.
30. **Don't ask for permission on the default next step** — if the proposed action is what the protocol already prescribes (commit after edits, push after commit, log a flaw you found, fix a gap you identified), do it and report — don't ask "Want me to...?" The Zero-Interruption Principle covers this, but agents often draw a false distinction between "clarification" (which they know not to ask) and "permission" (which they think is polite). Both are interruptions. Only ask when there's genuine ambiguity: which of two approaches to take, whether to proceed despite risk, or permission for a broad-scope change the protocol doesn't already authorize. If the user has already said "fix everything" or equivalent, that authorization covers all safe fixes — don't re-ask for each one. This binds **follow-up turns too**: the session is not over until the user says it is, and a "Want me to also...?" after the main work looks done is the same violation. "Should I fix this or just log it?" is never genuine ambiguity — the protocol already says fix safe issues, so a safe fix needs no ask. And note the inverse boundary: this rule prohibits asking *permission for prescribed actions*; it does NOT prohibit asking for a **missing input** only the user can supply (a credential, a URL, a decision between two valid architectures) — see Pitfall #34.
31. **Don't apply a review finding without reproducing it** — verify the claim against the file it cites (grep the referenced section) before editing. A review once claimed "the editions have 4 phases, not 5" — both have six — and the applied "fix" broke a correct Phase 5 reference. A confident wrong claim in a review propagates faster than a bug.
32. **Don't inspect stale local state** — if the user references another agent's work or asks you to "check what the session did," fetch first. Your local is stale the moment another agent pushes. Running `git show` or `git log` on a local that's behind remote gives you wrong information. See Git Workflow rule 7.
33. **Don't update the protocol by hand — and never re-bootstrap over an existing `.context_ledger/`.** Core updates happen only via `ledger-sync update` (whole-tree, verified, memory untouched); copying files into `.context_ledger/core/` or re-running bootstrap on a repo that already has `.context_ledger/` clobbers a verified core or the project's memory. One tool, one direction: package → core, never core → memory.
34. **A missing credential is a missing input, not a permission question** — if the protocol prescribes an action (push, clone a private repo) and you lack the credential to perform it, ask the user for the credential **up front, at Step 0–1, before any clone attempt**. Cloud/sandbox agents need a PAT for every push (even to a public repo) and for any private clone — don't wait for a 404 or a failed push to discover that, and never cite Pitfall #30 ("don't ask permission") as cover for leaving work undelivered. An agent once left 4 finished commits unpushed and called not-asking protocol compliance; it wasn't.
35. **Don't ship code that joins user-controlled input to a filesystem path without a traversal test** — catch-all routes, file-download endpoints, static-file servers, template loaders. Resolve the candidate and check containment (`candidate.resolve()` + `is_relative_to(base)` or equivalent), and test the encoded forms (`..%2f`, `%2e%2e%2f`, `%2e%2e`) — framework URL normalization will not save you. Write the traversal test before the commit, not after someone demonstrates the hole. An agent once noticed the unsafe pattern while writing it and shipped anyway; the exploit worked on the first try.
36. **Don't write infrastructure-as-code from memory** — `railway.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`, CI workflows, Terraform. Fetch the official schema and validate before commit (`jsonschema.validate`, `docker compose config`, `terraform validate`, provider CLI linters). Memory is not a substitute for the schema: an invented config block or a wrong enum casing fails the *first deploy*, the most expensive place to find it.
37. **Don't backlog a fix you could make with the same keystrokes it took to write the backlog entry** — if a finding is safe (small, localized, no behavior change for valid inputs), fix it on the spot. The backlog is for work that needs design decisions, migrations, or architectural judgment — not for one-liners. Backlogging a safe fix "for a future session" is Pitfall #30 in disguise.
38. **Don't `git add -A` (or `git add .`) when both surfaces are dirty** — that's how project code and `.context_ledger/` memory end up in one mixed commit, violating the two-surfaces rule mechanically rather than deliberately. Stage per surface: `git add .context_ledger/` for memory commits, explicit paths for project commits. If you're unsure what's dirty, `git status` first — always.
39. **Don't commit an append-only file whose diff shows removed lines** — before committing `agents/sessions.md`, `tasks/backlog.md`, `plans/decisions.md`, `inefficiencies/log.md`, or `flaws/log.md`, run `git diff <file>` and confirm every changed line is a `+`. A `-` line means you edited or overwrote history: restore the file and re-append instead. (Sole exception: the documented byte-identical-duplicate removal, which leaves a note in place.)
40. **Don't record a command containing a credential** — the authenticated clone/push one-liners (`x-access-token:${GIT_TOKEN}@...`) must never land in `system/environments.md` "verified commands", reports, session entries, or any tracked file; record the tokenless form and note "PAT required." Before any push that includes `.context_ledger/` changes, grep the staged diff for `x-access-token`, `github_pat_`, `ghp_`, `gho_` — all must come back empty.
41. **Don't write dates from memory** — run `date -u +%F` and use its output for session entries, reports, "last verified" fields, everything. Models autocomplete plausible-but-wrong dates (often from their training years); a wrong date in an append-only log is permanent and silently corrupts every "how stale is this?" judgment that later reads it.
42. **Don't claim verification without the evidence** — "tests pass" in a report or session entry must carry the exact command and its observed result (test count, exit status). If you didn't run it this session on this environment, write "not verified" and say what would verify it. A confident unverified claim is worse than an honest gap: the next agent builds on it.
43. **Don't absorb another agent type's identity from the project's memory** — `.context_ledger/` is shared by local AND cloud agents, so some of what it records is per-agent-type or per-machine, not per-project. Your edition comes from YOUR agent type at session start, never from whichever edition `workflows/active.md`'s last writer happened to be; `environments.md` blocks apply only to the machine you match by its "Identify by" line (never run another environment's verified commands or paths); PAT/token steps never apply to local agents no matter how many cloud sessions the logs show. The canonical failure: a cloud agent bootstraps a repo, the user pulls it locally, and the local agent starts doing PAT dances and re-cloning because it read the cloud agent's records as its own instructions.
44. **Don't cite `.context_ledger` vocabulary in product artifacts (one-way linkage)** — a product file (anything outside `.context_ledger/`) must stand on its own for someone who cloned only the product repo. Never put an ADR number, a bug ID (`B-YYYY-MM-DD-N`), "per ADR", or a `.context_ledger/` path in a product docstring, comment, or user-facing doc — those are dangling pointers into a `.context_ledger/` the reader doesn't have. If the reason matters, say it in plain words; the ADR link lives in `plans/decisions.md`, which may reference the code — never the reverse. `ledger-mem lint` catches the leak in your staged diff.

## Getting Unstuck

- **PAT redacted or missing?** The upload pipeline scrubs secrets from files. Ask the user to paste it in chat. Don't proceed without it if the repo is private.
- **Build failing?** Run the typecheck command first. Check if a recent commit broke something. Check `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` — a prior agent may have hit and solved this exact failure.
- **Dependencies acting up?** Delete `node_modules`/`venv` and the lockfile, reinstall fresh with the correct package manager.
- **Python `externally-managed-environment`?** Create a venv first: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`.
- **Push rejected (non-fast-forward)?** Another agent pushed. In single-agent mode, `git pull --rebase origin main`, resolve and retry. In collaboration mode, fetch/rebase your isolated branch; preserve both immutable event files. Product conflicts require peer comparison and an agreement, never a silent overwrite.
- **Push rejected (auth)?** The remote URL was stripped of the token. Re-add it: `git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:${GIT_TOKEN}@github.com/..."`, push, then strip again.
- **ORM errors?** Regenerate the client after schema changes (e.g., `prisma generate`).
- **Tool calls timing out?** After 2 consecutive timeouts, tell the user to restart the session.
- **Whatever unstuck you** — log it in `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md` so the next agent skips the struggle.

## Deliverables

By the end of the session provide:

- Summary of work completed
- Commits made (count + SHA range)
- Bugs found (by severity)
- Bugs fixed (with commit SHAs)
- Improvements implemented
- Performance optimizations
- Security observations
- Technical debt identified
- Open items for the next session (mirrored in `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md`)
- Recommended next steps
- Updated `.context_ledger/` (session entry, inefficiencies, tasks, system/plans — Steps 15–17)

The goal: leave the project — and its memory — in a better state than you found it.

## Final Note

This protocol is a living document. When you discover a new workflow rule, pitfall, or convention during a session, add it to the Common Pitfalls section so the next agent doesn't have to rediscover it.

> **Learnings about the project** go in `.context_ledger/memory/reviews/` in the repo.
> **Open work** goes in `.context_ledger/memory/tasks/backlog.md`.
> **Decisions** go in `.context_ledger/memory/plans/decisions.md`.
> **Project friction** goes in `.context_ledger/memory/inefficiencies/log.md`; **workflow/protocol friction** goes in `.context_ledger/memory/flaws/log.md` — always, honestly.
> **Learnings about this protocol** (like the PAT redaction issue) go back into this file.
> **Agent process within this sandbox** goes in `/home/z/my-project/worklog.md`; the durable cross-machine record is `.context_ledger/memory/agents/sessions.md`.
