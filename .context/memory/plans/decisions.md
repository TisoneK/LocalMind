# Architectural Decisions (append-only, ADR-style)

Decisions already made — future agents respect these rather than
relitigating them. To reverse one, append a new ADR that supersedes it.

---
## ADR-1: LocalMind is dark-only by design (2026-07-11)

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** `globals.css` defines both light (`:root`) and dark (`.dark`) CSS variable sets. shadcn/ui components use `dark:` Tailwind variants. But no theme toggle exists, and `.dark` was never applied to `<html>` — so shadcn components rendered in their light theme while custom components used hardcoded dark hex colors, causing visual inconsistency.
- **Decision:** Apply `.dark` class to `<html>` element by default (commit `9bfe8c8`). LocalMind is a dark-only app. Light theme variables in `globals.css` are retained for future theming support but are not currently active.
- **Consequences:** Future agents should NOT flag "missing `dark:` variants" as a theme gap — the app is intentionally dark-only. If a light theme is ever added, the hardcoded hex in custom components (`SettingsModal.tsx`, etc.) must be replaced with CSS variables first. See backlog item "Theming strategy decision needed" — the user may still decide to commit fully to dark-only (remove light variables) or implement a toggle.

## ADR-2: SSRF protection re-validates redirect targets (2026-07-11)

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** `web_fetch` used `httpx.follow_redirects=True`, which let httpx follow 302 redirects to internal IPs (169.254.169.254, localhost) without re-validation. The SSRF check (`_is_url_safe`) ran only on the initial URL. This is the classic SSRF redirect-bypass pattern — an attacker could coerce the agent into fetching cloud metadata endpoints or internal services.
- **Decision:** Set `follow_redirects=False` and implement manual redirect following with `_is_url_safe()` re-validation on every hop (commit `e49d54a`). Caps at 5 redirects. Resolves relative redirects via `httpx.URL.join()`.
- **Consequences:** Future agents adding URL-fetching code must follow this pattern — never use `follow_redirects=True` without per-hop SSRF re-validation. The regression tests in `tests/tools/test_web_fetch_ssrf_redirect.py` enforce this. If a new tool needs to fetch URLs, copy the redirect-following pattern from `web_fetch.py` rather than re-implementing it.

## ADR-3: Reports live in .context/reviews/ (not docs/report/) (2026-07-11)

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** Session 1 placed review reports in `docs/report/`. The `.context/` system (introduced Session 2) has a dedicated `reviews/` subdirectory that travels with the repo as agent memory.
- **Decision:** Migrate `docs/report/2026-07-11-review.md` → `.context/reviews/2026-07-11-review.md`. Delete `docs/report/`. All future review reports go in `.context/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md`.
- **Consequences:** Future agents look for prior reviews in `.context/reviews/`, not `docs/report/`. The old `docs/report/` directory is gone — don't recreate it.

## ADR-4: .context/ directory is the agent memory system (2026-07-11)

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** Prior to Session 2, there was no structured way for agents to share context across sessions. Each agent started blind. The user and Super Z co-designed the `.context/` system (packaged at `TisoneK/.context`) to solve this.
- **Decision:** LocalMind carries a `.context/` directory at the repo root, committed to git. It contains: `system/` (environments, ai-models), `user/` (identity, preferences), `workflows/active.md`, `agents/sessions.md` (append-only), `reviews/` (one file per session), `tasks/` (current + backlog), `plans/decisions.md` (append-only ADRs), `inefficiencies/log.md` (append-only), and `secrets/` (local-only, self-gitignored).
- **Consequences:** Every agent session reads `.context/` at startup (Step 3) and updates it at the end (Steps 15–17). Append-only logs are never edited — corrections are appended. No secrets in tracked `.context/` files. Context updates commit with `chore(context):` prefix. The protocol lives in the `TisoneK/.context` package repo, not in each project — projects bootstrap from `context-skeleton/` and the `.context/` data lives its own life.
