rem A .cmd file is executed by cmd.exe, which ignores the PowerShell
rem execution policy; this shim starts the matching .ps1 with
rem -ExecutionPolicy Bypass so the documented Windows invocations work on
rem a stock machine without any Set-ExecutionPolicy step. It targets
rem Windows PowerShell 5.1 on purpose: it ships with every Windows 10+
rem install, while pwsh 7 is an optional add-on.
