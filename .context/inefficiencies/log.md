# Inefficiency Log (append-only, mandatory)

Every session appends one block — honestly. Friction you absorb silently
is friction the next agent hits blind. "None this session" is valid only
if literally nothing slowed you down.

- **Problem:** PAT pasted in the kickoff template file was redacted to `[REDACTED:github_token]` by the upload pipeline — agent couldn't clone the private repo.
- **Cost:** One full round-trip with the user (agent reported "PAT is a placeholder", user had to paste it in chat).
- **Cause:** The IM gateway / file-upload pipeline scrubs secrets from uploaded files before they reach the agent.
- **Workaround / fix:** User pasted the PAT directly in chat. Agent used it as a transient env var.
- **Prevent next time:** Protocol now documents this — PAT goes in chat, never in the file. The `ai-engineering-protocol.md` Pre-Flight section warns about this explicitly.

- **Problem:** `pip install -e ".[dev]"` failed with `externally-managed-environment` error on system Python.
- **Cost:** One failed command before creating a venv.
- **Cause:** System Python 3.12 on the sandbox is locked down per PEP 668.
- **Workaround / fix:** Created a venv: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`, then `pip install` succeeded.
- **Prevent next time:** Protocol now says "ALWAYS create a virtualenv first" in Step 4 and lists it as Common Pitfall #3.

## 2026-07-11 — Super Z / GLM-4.5 (Session 2)

- **Problem:** `git push` failed after the first commit because the remote URL had been stripped of the token (Step 2 strips it for security).
- **Cost:** One failed push before figuring out the re-add-token → push → strip-token dance.
- **Cause:** The clone command embeds the token in the remote URL, which persists in `.git/config` on disk. Step 2 correctly strips it, but that breaks subsequent pushes.
- **Workaround / fix:** Re-add the token to the remote URL before push, push, then strip it again: `git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:${GIT_TOKEN}@..." && git push && git remote set-url origin https://github.com/...`
- **Prevent next time:** Protocol Step 12 now documents this explicitly with the exact commands. Common Pitfall #19 added.

## 2026-07-11 — Super Z / GLM-4.5 (Session 2)

- **Problem:** The LocalMind clone from Session 1 was gone — the sandbox wipes `/home/z/my-project/` between sessions (only `/home/z/my-project/download/` persists).
- **Cost:** Had to re-clone the repo (30s) and re-create the backend venv (60s). No work lost since everything was pushed to remote.
- **Cause:** Cloud sandbox environment — no persistent storage between sessions by design.
- **Workaround / fix:** Re-cloned and re-installed. All prior work was safely on `origin/main`.
- **Prevent next time:** This is inherent to the sandbox. The `.context/` system (now bootstrapped) means the next session will at least have full context of what happened before, even though the local clone is gone. No protocol change needed — just be aware that cloud sandboxes start fresh each session.

## 2026-07-11 — Super Z / GLM-4.5 (Session 2)

- **Problem:** The SSRF redirect bypass fix initially had a test failure — `_is_url_safe()` tried to resolve `attacker.example.com` via real DNS, which failed (the domain doesn't exist).
- **Cost:** One failed test run before mocking `_is_url_safe` directly.
- **Cause:** The test mocked `httpx.AsyncClient` but not `_is_url_safe` — the real function still ran and hit real DNS.
- **Workaround / fix:** Mocked `_is_url_safe` with `patch("tools.web_fetch._is_url_safe", side_effect=_fake_is_url_safe)` so the test isolates the redirect-following logic without DNS dependency.
- **Prevent next time:** When testing functions that call external network resolution, mock the resolution function too — not just the HTTP client. Added a comment in the test file explaining this.
